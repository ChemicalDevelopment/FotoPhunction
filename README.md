# About

Written by FRC 3966. You take a photo, then the app finds lines / equations of best fit.
You can change the color of the marker/pen it detects, so you can draw multiple lines in different colors, then select the color of the graph you want to fit, and click the "Update Settings", or tap on the photo.

# Finding

Search us up on app/play store. We might have a version online at chemicaldevelopment.us/$dir
